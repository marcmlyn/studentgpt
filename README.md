# ðŸ§  Ideas/enhancements

 - [ ] research what community has already done in Python that may serve similar purpose
 - [ ] chat with your own text knowledge base and save state of it (local (crude) CRUD database?)
 - [ ] get user answers and rate them in comparison with _ideal_ (bot) answers, highlight what can be improved 
 - [ ] create interactive quizzes based on knowledge base and syllabus suited to your weaknesses
